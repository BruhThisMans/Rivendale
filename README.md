# Rivendale
This project uses what I have learned from Codecademy's Computer Science path up to this point. I implemented a town called Rivendale and it is a late 1800's to early 1900's town. 
The inspiration of the building names are from Red Dead Redemption 2 and obviously the town name is from Lord of the Rings. It's set up within python represented as a graph. You can navigate it using user input. 
The program will give you the fastest route you can take to reach building to building. 
The main takeaway from creating this program is to show I can basically create a version of Google Maps. Obviously its not perfected nor as complex like Google Maps but it uses similar algorithms. Have fun navigating!
